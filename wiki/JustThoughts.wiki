=Programming=

== Loading shaders ==
You can write in the *.mtl* (material file) 
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_(shader filename without extension)
}}}
so every object that uses this material, uses shader as well.
Example:
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_toon
}}}
will load *toon.vert* and *toon.frag* shaders.

=Work in progress=

==Pathes:==
If objects name contains `Path_` then it will be used as path.
So `Path_camerapath1` will load camerapath1 and this can be
attached to the camera/object (coming soon) .

==Bounding volumes==
If objects name contains `BBox_` or `BSphere_` then object will be used
as bounding box/sphere. `BBox_car` uses this bbox to object named car
(coming soon).

= Known bugs =

 * test1, (2D mode), when you change window size, images doesnt scale.
 * test8, when updating lights, scene flickers (on linux)
