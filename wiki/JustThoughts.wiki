=Programming=

== Loading shaders ==
You can write in the *.mtl* (material file) 
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_(shader filename without extension)
}}}
so every object that uses this material, uses shader as well.
Example:
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_toon
}}}
will load *toon.vert* and *toon.frag* shaders. Test9 shows how to do it.


=Work in progress=

 * collision detection and paths doesnt work very well

----

*Linux + Mesa:*
If one see this warning:

*WARN ONCE*

*Ran out of GART memory*

it can crash linux. 

You need to edit *xorg.conf* and add to the device section *Option "GARTSize" "64"*.

*Example:*
{{{
Section "Device"
   Identifier "Configured Video Device"
   Option      "GARTSize" "64"
}}}
