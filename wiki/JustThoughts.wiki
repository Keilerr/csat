=Programming=

== Loading shaders ==
You can write in the *.mtl* (material file) 
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_(shader filename without extension)
}}}
so every object that uses this material, uses shader as well.
Example:
{{{  
map_Ka Shader_toon
}}}
will load *toon.vert* and *toon.frag* shaders. Test9 shows how to do it.

==Paths:==
If name of the object contains `Path_` then it will be used as path.
So `Path_camerapath1` will load camerapath1 and this can be
attached to the camera/object. And Test10 shows how to do it.

----
=Work in progress=

==Bounding volumes==
If name of the object contains `BBox_` or `BSphere_` then object will be used
as bounding box/sphere. `BBox_car` uses this bbox to object named car
(coming soon).


----
= Known bugs =
* collision detection doesnt work.

----

*Linux + Mesa:*
If one see this warning:

*WARN ONCE*

*Ran out of GART memory*

it can crash linux. 

You need to edit *xorg.conf* and add to the device section *Option "GARTSize" "64"*.

*Example:*
{{{
Section "Device"
   Identifier "Configured Video Device"
   Option      "GARTSize" "64"
}}}
